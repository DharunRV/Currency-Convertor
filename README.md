Overview:
This Currency Converter Mini Project is a Java application designed to convert currencies based on the latest exchange rates. It provides a simple command-line interface where users can input the amount, source currency, and target currency to get the converted amount.

Goal:
Create a real-time currency converter application using only core Java to provide users with a simple and efficient tool for currency conversions.

Process:

1. Design: Define the application's structure and functionality, identifying the core components required for currency conversion.
2. Implementation: Develop the application's logic using basic Java programming techniques, including input/output handling and data manipulation.
3. Integration: Utilize publicly available exchange rate data sources or APIs accessible via HTTP requests to fetch real-time exchange rates within the Java application.
4. Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of currency conversion functionalities.
5. Refinement: Refine the application based on testing feedback, optimizing performance and user experience where possible.

Features:

1. Basic Currency Conversion: Allow users to input an amount, select the source, and target currencies for conversion.
2. Real-Time Exchange Rates: Fetch the latest exchange rates from external sources to ensure accurate conversions.
3. Simple User Interface: Design a straightforward command-line interface or basic GUI using Java's built-in libraries for user interaction.
4. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid input and connectivity issues.
5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure the application can run on any platform with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, maintaining portability and accessibility.



Prerequisites:
JDK (Java Development Kit) is installed on your system.
Internet connection (required for fetching the latest exchange rates).
